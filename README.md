SOC Home Lab
1. Project Overview

This project documents the design and implementation of a lightweight Security Operations Center (SOC) home lab built using virtualization. The objective is to simulate real-world blue team monitoring by integrating a SIEM platform and network intrusion detection system within an isolated lab environment.

The lab is designed to:

Collect and analyze system and network logs

Detect malicious activity such as port scans and brute-force attempts

Map detections to MITRE ATT&CK techniques

Simulate attacker behavior in a controlled environment

The environment is optimized to run on limited hardware resources (8GB RAM, dual-core CPU), requiring careful system design and resource allocation.
