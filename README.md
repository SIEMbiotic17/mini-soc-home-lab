# SOC Home Lab

## 1. Project Overview

This repository documents the design and implementation of a personal Security Operations Center (SOC) home lab built to simulate real-world blue team monitoring and detection workflows.

The primary goal of this project is to gain hands-on experience with log analysis, threat detection, and incident investigation by deploying a SIEM platform and a network intrusion detection system inside an isolated virtualized environment.

The lab is intentionally designed to run on limited hardware (8GB RAM, dual-core CPU), requiring careful resource allocation and architectural decisions to maintain performance while preserving realism.

Through this project, I aim to:

* Build practical experience with SIEM and IDS deployment
* Generate and analyze security events in a controlled lab
* Simulate attacker techniques and observe detection behavior
* Understand how alerts map to real-world attack patterns

This project is structured and documented incrementally to reflect a real SOC deployment lifecycle — from infrastructure setup to detection engineering and incident response analysis.
